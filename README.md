# weather-report-comparator
1. Get temperature from UI for city in config, using selenium
2. Get temperature from API for city in config, using rest-assured
3. Comparator test to compare the both the temperatures 

```
To Execute Test Cases
mvn clean verify 
mvn clean install 
```


Future Expansion left because of timelimit. 
- few more individual testcases for each api & ui
- removing softassertions in comparator test
- more configurable values.
